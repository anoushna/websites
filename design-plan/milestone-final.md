# Project 3, Final Submission: Design Journey

[← Table of Contents](design-journey.md)


> **Replace ALL _TODOs_ with your work.** (There should be no TODOs in the final submission.)
>
> Be clear and concise in your writing. Bullets points are encouraged.
>
> Place all design journey images inside the "design-plan" folder and then link them in Markdown so that they are visible in Markdown Preview.
>
> **Everything, including images, must be visible in _Markdown: Open Preview_.** If it's not visible in the Markdown preview, then we can't grade it. We also can't give you partial credit either. **Please make sure your design journey should is easy to read for the grader;** in Markdown preview the question _and_ answer should have a blank line between them.


## Milestone 1 Feedback Revisions
> Explain what you revised in response to the Milestone 1 feedback (1-2 sentences)
> If you didn't make any revisions, explain why.

My feedback from Milestone 1 was to make sure my modals cover the whole page as my sketches still showed the Header and Footer when the Modal was pressed on. Therefore, my revision from the Milestone 1 to Final Submission is to make sure that the modal covers the whole screen and everything in the background is blurred.

This was not included in Milestone 1 feedback, but a TA reccomended that for my map modal to instead of doing Enlarge Map to do Show Map as the interactivity is more intutive for users.


## Interactivity Usability Justification
> Explain how the interactivity _functionally_ improves the user's experience and helps them accomplish their goals. (i.e. Your interactivity does _more_ than add additional clicks; the interactivity doesn't insert additional barriers for the user when working towards their goals.)
> Explain how your interactivity's design effectively uses affordances, visibility, feedback, and familiarity.
> Write a paragraph (3-4 sentences)

My three instances of interactivity in my website improve the overall user experience by complementing the goals of the audience. One goal of the audience is to be able to navigate Apple Fest, and many users I interviewed mentioned a map would be helpful. Therefore, on my Map Page, I created a Show Map button that allows users to have an enlarged view of the map (that is already available to them on the Home page) so they can easily view and read the map before or while at Apple Fest. The other modal I designed is on the Crafts page: it hides the long list of vendors unless the View Vendors button is clicked. This interactivity was added so users can decide whether they want to view the long list and so they are not overwhelemed with scrolling past it while they are on the Crafts page. The people I interviewed mentioned their main interest was with the Food Vendors so I only added this feature to the Craft Vendors page. Both modals involve a button that is designed to be familar to users and its color (orange matching the theme of the website) makes the button visible right away. The button to close out of the modals is also visible with an orange X button on the top right corner (common practice amongst websites). The hamburger menu also enhances the user experience when they are on a narrow browser window as they can click the drop down hamburger menu to easily access the navigation links, and the black border surronding the hamburger menu makes it visible to users.


## Tell Us What to Grade
> We aren't re-grading your entire Project 1 or 2.
> We are only grading the interactivity you added to the project.
> Tell us where (what pages) we can find your interactivity and how to use it.
> **We will only grade what you list here;** if it's not listed here, we won't grade it. **No exceptions.**

I created a hamburger menu at the top of each page. When the browser window becomes narrow, the navigation menu turns into a hamburger menu that can be clicked. I created a modal on the Crafts Page: "View Vendors" button reveals the long list of vendors at Apple Fest when clicked, the X button on the top right corner is how to click out of the modal. I also created a modal on the Map Page: when the "Show Map" button is clicked the enlarged map is opened, and users can close out of the modal with the X button on the top right corner.


## Self-Reflection
> Reflect on what you learned during this assignment. How have you improved from Project 1? What would you do differently next time? (2-3 sentences)

This assignment was my first introduction to Javascript, which is a very useful and helpful language for enhancing the familarlity and experience of websites. I enjoyed adding the interactive elements because it was a great learning experience for me and also improved the user experience of my website. What I would do differently next time is add more interactivity throughout the whole site (making sure it aligns with user's goals) as I think generally all the pages could be enhanced with added interactivity.


> Take some time here to reflect on how much you've learned since you started this class. It's often easy to ignore our own progress. Take a moment and think about your accomplishments in this class. Hopefully you'll recognize that you've accomplished a lot and that you should be very proud of those accomplishments! (1-3 sentences)

I learnt a lot of useful skills in the class and feel like I am more comfortable with HTML and CSS, and understand the basics of Javascript. I really enjoyed being able to code and design my own websites and be able to see them in 'Live' mode felt very rewarding.
